# Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
__This project aims to develop an accurate and automated system for pneumonia detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system takes chest X-ray images as input and classifies them into normal or pneumonia cases. It is designed to overcome the limitations of existing systems, including low accuracy, high false positive rates, and low speed. The system is also intended to be user-friendly and easily implementable in clinical settings to assist radiologists in their diagnosis and decision-making process.__

## Features
* Accurate pneumonia detection: The system utilizes CNNs to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and pneumonia cases.
* Automated classification: The system automatically classifies chest X-ray images, reducing the need for manual interpretation.
* Overcoming limitations: The project addresses the limitations of existing systems by aiming for improved accuracy, reduced false positive rates, and faster processing speed.
* User-friendly interface: The system is designed to be easy to use and implement in clinical settings, providing a seamless experience for radiologists.
* Assistive tool for diagnosis: The system assists radiologists in their diagnosis and decision-making process by providing accurate and timely pneumonia detection.
## Requirements
* Python 
* TensorFlow 
* OpenCV 
* Scikit
* NumPy 
* Matplotlib 
* Seaborn
* Keras
## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Drtech-859/SCANIA
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd pneumonia-detection
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. Place the chest X-ray images in the images directory.
2. Run the main script: python detect_pneumonia.py
3. The system will process the images and classify them into normal or pneumonia cases.
4. The results will be displayed, indicating whether each image is normal or pneumonia.
5. Review the results and use them to assist in the diagnosis and decision-making process.
